##### 1. Iteratees, Oleg Kiselyov

Advantage of iteratees over lazy IO and handle IO: both high level abstraction and precise control. Confusion over the `bind` opetion of generalized verison of iteratee. See [Iteratee](http://okmij.org/ftp/Haskell/Iteratee/) for better illustratoin.



##### 2. Retrofiting Linear Types

Lamdba Calculus core for implementing lineary types, their semantics, and applications.  



##### 3. Functional Programming with Overloading and High-order Polymorphism

Gives the reason for using type classes as to achieve restricted polymorphism, and higher-order type in type constructuctors. 

Gives some applications of the combination of type classes and higher-order types. Note that monad transformers could be modeled in a category theory way.
